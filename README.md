# Building-Energy-Efficiency-Data-Analysis
## Developed a building model and used meteorological data with conceptual models and analytical tools to predict energy efficient measures for residential buildings in Nigeria, Africa.


### INTRODUCTION
##### This research analytical project focus is to develop passive measures for energy efficient residential building in warm climate using Nigeria as Nigeria as a case study. Many residential buildings in Nigeria depends on air conditioning system to cool their building which in turns increase the energy consumption of the buildings. This data analytical research is to recommend measures that can make a residential building cool without the use of air conditioning system. This research relied on many years of weather history for the energy model simulation.


The Analytical project is divided into five stages 
1.	Meteorological data analysis
2.  Development of conceptual masses to build an energy model 
3.  Analysis of model with different building energy measures 
4.  Visualization of Result 
5.  Recomendations 

### Meteorological data analysis
With the use of Grasshope definitions and python programming language, the wind, sunlight, temperature and outdoor comfort of three different locations in Nigeria was analysed from the year 1960 - 2020. Few of the analysis visuals are displayed below.
