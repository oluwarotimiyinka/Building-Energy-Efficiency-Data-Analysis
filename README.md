# Building-Energy-Efficiency-Data-Analysis
### Developed a building model and used meteorological data with analytical models and analytical tools to predict energy efficient measures for residential buildings in Nigeria, Africa.

##### The Analytical project is divided into five stages 
1. 1. Meteorological data analysis
1. 2. Development of conceptual masses to build an energy model 
3. Analysis of model with different building energy measures 
4. Visualization of Result 
5. Recomendations
